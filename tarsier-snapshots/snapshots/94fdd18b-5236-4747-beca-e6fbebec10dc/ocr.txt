               [ 40 ] As a user, I may not want to be tied down to OpenAI. There are a lot of companies offering APIs for LLMs. We should
               explore what are the best, and provide an interface to select between them

               [ 52 ] I did some initial analysis and it appears that AutoGPT uses Langchain in [ @ 55 ] chain.ts [ 53 ] to communicate with [ 87 ] No milestone
               OpenAl. Since Langchain appears to offer support for other LLMs ( see e.g.
               [ @ 56 ] https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/llms [ 54 ] ) then a possible solution might be to
               parameterize the LLM ( s ) in chain.ts. Specific settings would have to be provided for supported LLM ( s ).                  [ 89 ] Development
