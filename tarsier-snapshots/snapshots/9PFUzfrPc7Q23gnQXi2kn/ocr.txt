                                              [41] Hi Guys,

                                              [42] 1) How many classes/credits per term is considered fulltime"

                                              [43] 2) How do you think being Unclassified for 1 term (Jan 2012) - completing 12 prerequisite credits would look ... if I am planning on being accepted to a
                                              degree in May 2012?

                                              [44] Just put those credits towards my new degree?
                                              [45] Do you think this would hurt me ...
                                              [46] Anyone accepted been in a similar situation?

                                              [47] Thanks so much

                                              [49] from ubc website:
                                              [50] Generally, we do not recommend repeating courses to improve your overall GPA. Students who enroll in unclassified, non-degree programs for the sole
                                              purpose of improving their academic qualifications are advised that only a small proportion of such candidates gain admission."

                                              [59] I don't think that completing prerequisite courses as unclassified would necessarily make your application look bad. In that scenario you are at least
                                              studying a coherent line of school work. That part of the FAQ refers to individuals who primarily take bird" courses to increase their GPA.

                                              [60] That being said, it's always good to email adcom and see what they think.

                                              [61] Good luck.

                                              [68] Hi there;

                                              [69] In first year I did 8 courses, In second year I did 9 during the academic year (and 1 during the summer), and I did 9 in third year (and 2 during the summer).

                                              [70] I had a reduced course load because I was dealing with serious family issues and then grieving the death of an immediate family member that I was very
                                              close to. Along with the grief I had symptoms of depression (and this is well documented).

                                              [71] However, I did manage to maintain a 95 average/ 3.99 GPA while taking rigorous courses.

                                              [72] Do you think I need to demonstrate 10 courses an academic year before applying to UBC?

                                              [73] I have a three-year BSc degree, and I am considering taking this next year away from university to gain extra-curricular experience and hopefully earn some
                                              money, but I am concerned that applying to UBC with no full-time years on my transcript may be hopeless.


                                              [74] Thanks for your input.

                                              [82] My condolences to your family. Congrats on achieving such high marks though, that is no easy feat.

                                              [83] Are you IP? Yes, you should definitely give it a shot, don't worry too much about the full time thing. A person who averages 95 in 8 and 9 courses isn't
                                              going to drop to a 60 by taking 1 more course

                                              [90] I think you should contact UBC about whether or not they care about taking 24 or 27 credits rather than 30. I took 25 credits in 2nd year and ended up fine.
                                              A 95 average is pretty ridiculous even for OOP let alone IP, so I think you should definitely apply.

                                              [99] I guess my concerns about the reduced course load mostly stems from the fact that some of the other Canadian medical schools list a full-course load for
                                              at least one year as an absolute requirement, so I thought perhaps very few students with a reduced course load make it into UBC even though they state on
                                              their admission site that it is not technically necessary.

                                              [100] Anyways, I will take the advice of emailing UBC, and will later post their reply in here in case it is helpful for other students with similar concerns.

                                              [101] Thanks again.
