				    [ 53 ] Hi Guys ,
				    [ 54 ] 1 ) How many  classes / credits per term is considered " fulltime " ?
	   [ 49 ] Members
	    [ @ 50 ]    153
				    [ 55 ] 2 ) How do you  think being Unclassified  for 1 term ( Jan 2012 ) - completing 12 prerequisite  credits would  look ... if I am planning on being accepted  to a
				   degree  in May  2012 ?
				    [ 56 ] Just put those  credits towards  my  new  degree ?
				    [ 57 ] Do you think  this would hurt me  ...
				    [ 58 ] Anyone  accepted   been  in a similar situation ?
				    [ 59 ] Thanks  so much   [ @ 60  ]
				    [ 61 ] from ubc  website :
				    [ 62 ] " Generally , we do not recommend    repeating courses  to improve  your  overall GPA . Students  who  enroll in unclassified , non - degree programs for the sole
				   purpose   of improving  their academic  qualifications are advised  that only a small  proportion of such  candidates   gain admission . "

				    [ 71 ] I don't think that completing prerequisite  courses  as unclassified would   necessarily make  your  application look  bad . In that scenario you are at least
				   studying  a coherent  line of school work  . That part of the FAQ refers to individuals who  primarily take  " bird " courses to increase their GPA .
				    [ 72 ] That being  said , it's always good to email adcom  and  see what  they think .
				    [ 73 ] Good  luck .

	       [ @ 75 ]	     [ 80 ] Hi
					     there ;
	      ЗА
				    [ 81 ] In first year I did 8 courses , In second year I did 9 during the academic  year ( and 1 during the summer  ) , and I did 9 in third year ( and 2 during the
	    [ 76 ] Members	 summer   ) .
	    [ @ 77 ]    129
				    [ 82 ] I had a reduced  course  load because   I was dealing with serious  family issues and  then grieving the  death of an  immediate  family member    that I was very
				   close  to . Along with the grief I had symptoms  of depression   ( and this is well documented  ) .
				    [ 83 ] However  , I did manage to maintain  a 95 %  average / 3.99 GPA  while taking  rigorous courses  .
				    [ 84 ] Do you think  I need to demonstrate   10 courses  an academic   year  before applying  to UBC  ?
				    [ 85 ] I have a three - year BSc degree , and I am considering  taking this next year away  from  university to gain extra - curricular experience and hopefully  earn
				   some   money  , but I am concerned   that applying to UBC   with no full - time years on my transcript may  be hopeless .
				    [ 86 ] Thanks  for your input .

	       [ @ 88 ]	     [ 93 ] Hi ADH ,
				    [ 94 ] My condolences    to your family . Congrats on achieving  such  high marks  though  , that is no easy feat .

				    [ 95 ] Are you IP ? Yes , you should definitely give it a shot , don't worry too much about the  full time thing . A person who averages  95 %  in 8 and 9 courses   isn't
				   going  to drop to a 60 %  by taking 1 more  course

	       [ @ AMITI 97 ]
				    [ 102 ] I think you should  contact  UBC  about  whether  or not they  care about  taking 24 or 27  credits rather than 30. I took 25 credits in 2nd  year and ended   up
				   fine . A 95 % average  is pretty ridiculous even for OOP  let alone IP , so I think you should definitely apply .

				    [ 111 ]  guess  my  concerns   about the  reduced  course  load mostly  stems  from  the fact that some  of the other Canadian   medical  schools  list a full - course load
				   for at least one year as  an absolute  requirement  , so I thought perhaps  very few  students  with a reduced  course  load make   it into UBC even though   they state on
				   their admission   site that it is not technically necessary .
				    [ 112 ] Anyways  , I will take the advice of emailing UBC  , and will later post their reply in here in case it is helpful for other students with similar concerns .
				   [ [ 113 ] Thanks  again .
