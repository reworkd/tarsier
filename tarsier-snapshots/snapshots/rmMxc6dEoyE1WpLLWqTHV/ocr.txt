   [ @ 85 ] crowTrobot        [ 92 ] I'd keep the i7-950 for now. Not worth it, especially considering Haswell retail overclocks like garbage. The upside
   [ 86 ] Deal Addict         of going with 1150 is that it uses a lot less power, has integrated graphics so you can still use it just in case your video
                              card dies, new CPUs support newer instructions sets for some programs that can utilize it, native USB3 and SATA6,
   [ @ 87 ]  7                and PCI - E 3.0.
                              [ 93 ] Most likely your X58 motherboard has USB3 and SATA6 functionality already anyway via 3rd party ( not really any
                              worse than native Intel, as it can be controller dependent specially with USB 3 ) and PCI - E 3.0 advantage is marketing
                              gimmick right now when it comes to the crop of current video cards as the lanes are not exactly bottlenecked.

                              [ 196 ] Same with my L5640. Even though the multipliers suck and only does 18x. Had it run at 212BCLK but that
                              required so much voltage, I'd settle for 3.6GHz. Used a 990X purely on GHz basis for comparison.
