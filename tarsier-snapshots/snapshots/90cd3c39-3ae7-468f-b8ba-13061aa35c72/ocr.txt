                                                    immersed in the highly technical and complex world of tax law , but our clients are rightfully focused on growing their
                                                    business or successfully completing a transaction . What I enjoy most is bridging that gap - explaining and breaking
                                                    down the most difficult tax issues facing our clients into clear , digestible guidance . By promoting our clients '
                                                    understanding about tax issues , they feel confident in their decisions and that they have achieved the best possible
                                                    outcome .
