[ 53 ] Pricing transparency

[ 54 ] Effective January 1, 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is requiring hospitals to make standard charges public. CMS issued a final rule on November 15, 2019 that provides
     the details related to the required information. Hospitals are expected to update this information at least annually or more often as appropriate, to reflect current charges. Note the standard
     charges provided may not accurately reflect what any given individual is likely to pay for a particular service, as this will be dependent upon your insurance coverage and the terms of the
     insurance plan. You should check with your insurance coverage to determine if you will have, any out of pocket costs. Note, some charges may be subject to change during the year without
     notice and the timing of updates may affect the posted charges on this site.
[ 55 ] Note that other healthcare providers who may separately bill the patient may provide some services in our hospital and that provider may or may not participate with the same health insurers
     or health maintenance organizations as our hospital.
[ 56 ] For general billing inquiries, to request an itemized bill, or to pay a bill, contact our Central Business Office at ( 888 ) 868-1103. If you need financial assistance related to an outstanding balance
     due, please refer to our financial hardship policy and contact our Central Business Office at ( 888 ) 868-1103 to determine if you qualify for financial assistance.
