                      back   . not  sure   if this will create    duplicates    , or if my   catalog   will  recognize     the  image    files  and
                      reconnect      to  my  catalog    .....

                [ 155  ] It looks   like  [ 157  ] Find  > All Missing    Files [ 156   ] was    added    in version    12.   So , I don't  think
               there    is an  easy   way   to  find  missing    files in  version   7  other   than   by  manually     looking    for a  question
