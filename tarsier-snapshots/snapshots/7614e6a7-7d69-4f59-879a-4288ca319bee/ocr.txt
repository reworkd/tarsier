  [ 25 ] Apply now >
                       [ 27 ] Our team brings OpenAl's most capable technology to the world
                       through our products. Most recently, we released ChatGPT, GPT - 4, the
                       Whisper API, and DALL - E. We empower consumers and developers alike to
                       use and access our start - of - the - art Al models, allowing them to do things
                       that they've never been able to before.
                       [ 28 ] Across all product lines, we ensure that these powerful tools are used
                       responsibly. This is a key part of OpenAl's path towards safely deploying
                       broadly beneficial Artificial General Intelligence ( AGI ). Safety is more
                       important to us than unfettered growth.

                       product teams to build a world - class model customization experience for
                       our API developers. Above all, you will be responsible for ensuring the safe
