                                           [ 27 ] The school offers a general program leading to a bachelor of science ( BSc ) or bachelor of arts ( BA ) degree. This
                                          undergraduate degree is appropriate for many interdisciplinary areas. Visit [ @ 29 ] www.cs.sfu.ca [ 28 ] ] for

                                          [ 30 ] Admission Requirements
                                           [ 31 ] Entry into computing science programs is possible via
                                             [ 32 ] ] direct admission from high school
                                             [ 33 ] direct transfer from a recognized post - secondary institution, or combined transfer units from more than one
                                            post - secondary institution
                                          •  [ 34 ] internal transfer from within Simon Fraser University
                                           [ 35 ] Admission is competitive. A separate admission average for each entry route is established each term,
                                          depending on spaces available and subject to the approval of the Dean of Applied Sciences. Admission averages are
                                          calculated over a set of courses satisfying particular breadth constraints.
                                           [ 36 ] For detailed university admission requirements,

                                           [ 43 ] Internal Transfer
                                           [ 44 ] Internal transfer allows students to transfer, within Simon Fraser University, from one faculty to another.
                                           [ 45 ] Simon Fraser University students applying for School of Computing Science admission are selected on the basis
                                          of an admission Computing Related Grade Point Average ( CRGPA ) and Cumulative Grade Point Average ( CGPA ).
                                          The CRGPA is computed from all courses the student has taken from the following: ( CMPT 120, 128 or 130 ), ( CMPT
                                          125, 129 or 135 ), CMPT 225, ( CMPT 275 or 276 ), CMPT 295, CMPT 300, CMPT 307, MACM 101, ( CMPT 210 or
                                          MACM 201 ), MACM 316. Applicants must have completed at least one MACM course and at least two CMPT courses
                                          from this list before applying. At least two courses used in the CRGPA calculation must have been taken at SFU.
                                           [ 46 ] No course may be included in the average if it is a duplicate of any previous course completed at Simon Fraser
                                          University or elsewhere.
                                           [ 47 ] The average for admission based on internal transfer is competitive and the school sets competitive averages
                                          each term.
                                           [ 48 ] The CRGPA minimum average is 2.67 and the CGPA minimum average is 2.40 - the competitive averages will
                                          never be below these minima.

                                          [ 49 ] Continuation Requirements
                                           [ 50 ] Students who do not maintain at least a 2.40 CGPA will be placed on probation within the School. Courses
                                          available to probationary students may be limited. Each term, these students must [ @ 52 ] consult an advisor [ 51 ]
                                          prior to enrollment and must achieve either a term 2.40 term GPA or an improved CGPA. Students who fail to do so
                                          may be removed from the program.
                                           [ 53 ] Reinstatement from probationary standing occurs when the CGPA improves to 2.40 or better and is
                                          maintained.

                                           [ 54 ] Graduation Requirements
                                           [ 55 ] A GPA of 2.00 must be obtained for upper division courses used to fulfil the program requirements.

                                          **[ 56 ] Prerequisite Grade Requirement**
                                           [ 57 ] Computing science course entry requires a grade of C- or better in each prerequisite course.
                                           [ 58 ] A minimum 2.40 CGPA is required for 200, 300 and 400 division CMPT courses. For complete information,
