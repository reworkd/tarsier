    GREETINGS FROM                   [ 54 ] 1366 motherboards aren't cheap in the' used' market. And certainly you'd be able to

                                     you'd be better off pursuing a new platform based on a cheaper modern motherboard. Energy
                                     consumption should be less as well, and you'd get benefits like SATA - 3 support, PCI - E 3.0

                                     [ 93 ] Most likely your X58 motherboard has USB3 and SATA6 functionality already anyway via
                                     3rd party ( not really any worse than native Intel, as it can be controller dependent specially
                                     with USB 3 ) and PCI - E 3.0 advantage is marketing gimmick right now when it comes to the
                                     crop of current video cards as the lanes are not exactly bottlenecked.
